Install

    run "./setup.py install" under the dir of source code.

Usage

    For bash users, put shell/pinyin-comp.bash somewhere and source it in your ~/.bashc

    For zsh users, put shell/pinyin.comp.zsh somewhere and source it in your ~/.zshrc

Others

    tools/table-generator.py is used to generate pinyin_initial.py, based upon the contents of tools/unicode-han-pinyin.txt.

    If you feel the default pinyin_initial.py is too big, which cause sensible delay and un-wanted ambigurous, just use you favourite editor to modify tools/unicode-han-pinyin.txt, then regenerate pinyin_initial.py by running:

    "$ ./table-generate.py > pinyin_initial.py"
